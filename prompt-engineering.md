#### How to raise alkalinity in a reef aquarium

#### To raise alkalinity in a reef aquarium, you can follow these steps:

1. Test Alkalinity: Use a reliable test kit to measure the current alkalinity level in your aquarium. Alkalinity is typically measured in units of dKH (degrees of carbonate hardness) or meq/L (milliequivalents per liter).

2. Choose Alkalinity Buffer: Select a commercial alkalinity buffer that is designed specifically for reef aquariums. These buffers usually contain components such as carbonate, bicarbonate, and borate that help raise alkalinity.

3. Follow Instructions: Follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer for the selected alkalinity buffer. The dosage will depend on the size of your aquarium and the desired increase in alkalinity. It is important to add the buffer slowly, following the recommended increments, to avoid sudden alkalinity swings. 

4. Monitor Levels: After adding the buffer, retest the alkalinity regularly to monitor its progress. Adjustments may be necessary if the desired alkalinity level has not been reached.

5. Water Changes: Performing regular water changes with a salt mix that has a higher alkalinity can help raise alkalinity levels naturally over time.

6. Calcium Reactor or Kalkwasser: In advanced reef systems, a calcium reactor or the use of kalkwasser (calcium hydroxide solution) can be considered as additional methods to maintain or raise alkalinity. These methods require careful monitoring and adjustment.

Remember that stability is crucial in a reef aquarium, so avoid rapid or drastic changes in alkalinity levels. It is always recommended to research and consult with experienced reef aquarium hobbyists or professionals for specific advice tailored to your setup.

GPT gave a decent enough response, it certainly lacked the nuance of a professional aquaculturist or a marine biologist. But it did give accurate information and actionable advice.
