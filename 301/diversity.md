###  That Time When Women Stopped Coding

#### What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
    This decline occured around the same time that PC's were starting to become more
    commercially viably for the average family. 
#### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
    For the most part, boys were more likely to play around on their home computer
    then a girl. This gave them a leg up when taking computer science courses.
