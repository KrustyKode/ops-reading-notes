## OPS 301 readings

### What does “OSI” stand for?
    OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. 

### List the 7 layers of the OSI model and what each one is responsible for.
    Layer 7:
        Manages apps, supplies network services
    Layer 6:
        Data formatting, Encrypt/Decrypt, Compression/Decompresion
    Layer 5: Session -
        Session management, duplex control, Authentication/Authorization
    Layer 4: Transport -
        Sequencing, error control 
    Layer 3: Network Layer -
        switching/routing data packets
    Layer 2: Data Link -
        error correction, framing and addressing 
    Layer 1: Physical - 
        Pyhsical transmission of bits
### Distinguish which layers are the “hardware layers”, and which layers are the “software layers”. What does that even mean?
    Layers 1-3 are considered hardware layers.
    Controls the physical transmission of data.
    Handles raw data bits.
    Layers 4-7 are considered software layers.
    Logical Organization, error checking.

### How can the OSI model be used in troubleshooting?
    The OSI model can be used as a flow chart to help
    work through issues on a network. The chart can
    help remind you to check all aspects of a network.

### What is Wireshark?
    Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer.
    It's three main features include -
    1. Packet capture
    2. Filtering
    3. Visualization.

### What is a packet?
    A packet is a small unit of data that is transported over a network.

### What 3 high-level things does Wireshark accomplish? 
### How could these be used for nefarious purposes? For benevolent purposes?
    It's three main features include -
    1. Packet capturing 
    2. Filtering
    3. Visualization.
    These are powerful tools that could be used for food or bad.
    Someone could use these tools to monitor their network and 
    eliminate vulnerabilities. At the same time someone could use
    these tools to exploit those vulnerabilites.
