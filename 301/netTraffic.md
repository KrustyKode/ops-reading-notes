### SPAN vs TAP

#### What are the differences between SPAN and TAP?
    SPAN uses software on a switch to mirror traffic
    to a monitoring port, while TAP uses a dedicated 
    hardware device to copy all traffic between two network segments.
#### What types of network devices can support network traffic mirroring?
    Many different devices use traffic mirroring.
    Including switches, TAPS, load balancers and more!

#### How can network traffic mirroring be used for network security?
    Traffic mirroring can be used for threat detection, 
    forensic anaylsis and vulnerabulity detection.
#### Are there any legal or ethical considerations when using network traffic mirroring?
    Absolutely, snooping around on a network that you are not authorized
    to do so on can result in blocking or even legal action.
