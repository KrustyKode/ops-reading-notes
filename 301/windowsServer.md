### What’s the Difference Between Windows and Windows Server?

#### What is a server, and how is it different from a regular computer?
#### How would you describe this difference to a friend who doesn’t know much about computers?
    Servers differ from regular desktops in many ways, they are not designed
    to be used in the same way desktops are. A server is like a queen bee
    and you desktop would be a worker bee.

    Windows server allows an admin to disable updates entirelly. 
    This is not an option in Windows 10/home

#### Does Windows Server have different hardware requirements than Windows Home or Pro?
    Windows server can support much higher end hardware then the desktop version,
    allowing up to 24 TB of RAM!
