    Group policy is a feature of windows that allows an admin to cofigure os,
    apps and user settings

    GPOs are group policy objects. GPOs can be associated with things like registry policies,
    security options, software, etc.

#### How can the acronym “LSDOU” help you figure out which policies are in effect?
