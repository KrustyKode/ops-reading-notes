### SPAN vs TAP

### VPC

#### How can one host within a VPC any services that need to be public?
    A private cloud is similar to a reserved table at a busy resturant.
    In very untechnical terms, the table could either have no open chairs
    allowing no-one but those on the reservation to sit down, or there could 
    be one or more open seats to allow others to join the table.

#### What are examples of services that would live in the publicly-accessible part of the VPC? The privately-accessible part?
    Something like a webserver would make sense to be publically accessible.
    Other things, like a datacenter would probably be private.

#### What are the trade-offs of using a VPC vs traditional infrastructure?
    The main benefit of a VPC is the nearly unlimited scalability.
    Traditional infastructures offer far more control.
