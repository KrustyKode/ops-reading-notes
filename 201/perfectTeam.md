### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team


#### What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
    1. Mutual respect
        When team members feel respected, they feel comfortable sharing ideas, asking questions,
        and making mistakes without fear of being ridiculed. 
    2. Communication
        Psychologically safe teams use open and honest communication. Team members need to be able
        to share opinions even if they may be controversial. Vis versa, members must also be
        willing to hear out others.
    3. Shared responsibility
        team members should feel a shard responsibility for the success or 
        failure of the group as a whole.


#### Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
    In previous teams I've certainly been on both sides of the fences. 
    I've been involved in some really great teams, full of determined and
    motivating individuals. Teams like that make you want to improve,
    which is a great mindset to get in. 

    At the same time, I've been in some real stinkers too. Working in these teams was
    drudgery. Many times, we rehashed work that was already finished, or dropped key 
    tasks because communication was poor.


#### What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
    Teams that can reach a high degree of psychological safety are simply just more effective.
    The enviorment that people work in plays a key role in their productivity.
