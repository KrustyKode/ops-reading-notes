### How to remove malware from your Windows PC

#### What are the main differences between anti-virus and anti-malware software?
    Antivirus typically defends against more established threats, such as viruses and worms.
    Antimalware typically will defend against newer and more sophisticated threats.

#### What are some signs or symptoms that may indicate a malware infection on your PC?
    some common signs include slower-than-usual performance, pop-ups, and other anomalies.

#### Explain the difference between a full system scan and a quick scan when using antimalware software.
    a quick scan will not nessecarily check all files with a fine tooth comb, like a full scan would.
    Instead a quick scan looks at commonly infected areas.

#### What should you do if your computer is infected with ransomware?
    Step 1: Enter Safe Mode
    Step 2: Delete temporary files
    Step 3: Download malware scanners
    Step 4: Run a scan 
    Step 5: Fix your web browser
    Step 6: Recover your files if Windows is corrupt
    Step 7: Keep your PC clean


#### Compare and contrast malware removal techniques in Windows PCs with those in other operating systems like macOS or Linux. How might these different approaches reflect the cultural values and priorities of the technology users?
    While Windows and MacOS come equipped with their own security programs, Linux typically does not.
    Mac and Linux typically have stricter privledge management then Windows.
    Different people have varying levels of experience. Someone with not much background in cybersecurity
    might choose windows because of it's ease of use and built in features.
    Someone with more experience might prefer the open source possibilites that come with Linux.
