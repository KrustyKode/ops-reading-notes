### How to Use System Restore


#### What is the purpose of the Windows System Restore tool?
The system restore tool allows a user to basically turn back time on their computer. 
It creates a restore point that saves the current software, registry, and drivers. 
This can then be called up for whatever reason needed. 


#### How long does it usually take to use the System Restore tool in Windows?
Using the system restore tool is thankfully not too lengthy of a process. 
It takes anywhere from ten to thirty minutes, in most cases.


#### How do you start a System Restore from the command prompt?
Opening the system restore using the command prompt can be accomplished in three straightforward steps.
1. Open the command prompt, if not open already. This can be done by typing the first few letters of command into the search bar.
2. Once inside of the terminal, you will type 'rstrui.exe' and then hit enter.
3. This will open up the system restore wizard, and the regular instructions can now be followed.


#### What options are available if System Restore does not fix the problem?
If the system restores did not correct the issue, attempt to repeat the instructions. if the issue persists then try choosing an older restore point (if available).
