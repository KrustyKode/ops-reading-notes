### SolarwindsMSP: SSD Data Recovery Best Practices


#### What are some common indicators that an SSD may be failing?
    Due to ssds having no moving parts, there won't be any auidible clues that
    a drive is failing. But that there are still ways to tell. 
    Bad blocks, file system repair issues, crashing, and 
    forced read-only are some of the common syptoms.

#### How do SSD failures differ from HDD failures in terms of detectability?
    While issues with SSD's are not as obvious as HDD's, it is stillpossible to
    dignois the issue with some digging.

#### What are bad blocks in an SSD, and how do they affect its performance?
    Bad blocks are storage segments that are either corrupted or have
    physical damage. These areas impede data storage and retrival,

#### How can power cycling an SSD help resolve certain issues?
    Power cycling can help resolve a myriad of issues.
    It resets the drives internal state, helping to
    resolve any software issues.

#### How might this topic be relevant in the aftermath of a natural disaster? Describe how individuals or communities can use these techniques to recover data and resume their normal activities.
    After a large natural disaster, perhaps something like a large earthquke, 
    data that is inside damaged hardware could be recovered using these techniques.
