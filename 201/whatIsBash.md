  Other directories can be specified either permanently or temporarily using the PATH variable.

#### How can you determine if your system is running a Bash shell?
  There are a few different ways that you could do this. 
  `echo $0` run in the shell will display the currently running process, if you have bash the shell will print out bash.
  Typing `echo $SHELL` will also print the current shell in use.

#### What makes Bash scripting powerful and why is it considered scriptable? 
  bash is a truly powerful tool. There are a laundry list of diverse functions that can be called using it.
  Different bash scripts can do everything from changing colors in your shell to executing malicious code.

#### Bash scripting allows for customization, automation, and efficiency. Discuss methods or practices from your previous work experience or cultural background that aim to achieve similar goals in daily tasks. 
  I love to automate things. There is a piece of monitoring equipment I use in my coral tanks that actual supports Python scripts. I have my lights, dosing pumps, circulation, and tests all scripted.
