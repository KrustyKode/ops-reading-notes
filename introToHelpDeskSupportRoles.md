### Introduction to Help Desk Support Roles


##### What role does the help desk professional play within an organization, particularly in relation to customers?
  The help desk role is to ensure that systems are availble and operational both on the inside and on the public facing side. 
  The help desk often deals directly with customers, and often times the impression a customer gets from the help desk will be a big part the customers opinion of a company.

#### The article differentiates between hard and soft skills. In your culture or community, are there specific skills that are highly valued? How do they compare to the skills mentioned in the article?
  I grew up in an area where a lot of people were tradesmen. Hard skills that could be measured and certified far out-weighed soft skills. Everyone has at least heard someone talk about getting yelled at by their dad
  for holding the flashlight wrong while he's working on the car. That's a classic example of someone that has more then enough hard skills to accomplish the tasks, but they are hinbdered by the lack of soft skills.

#### Why have security skills become more important in recent years for help desk technicians?
  Security skills in the IT world are more important then ever. Organizations of every size and scope are coming under attack ever more frequently. 
  Malware is a very common threat; recognizing and resolving it, especially when dealing with customers is required.

#### How do writing skills and critical thinking skills play a vital role in the work of help desk technicians?
  typing is going to a large majority of a help desk professionals job. Being able to clearly and consicsly communicate with coworkers and customers is paramount.
  Knowing how to quickly and effectively search or make updates to a knowledge base is required.

  It's always nice when something goes wrong and then the first troubleshooting step you take clears it all up. Unfortunately this is not always the case. 
  Complex problems may have many different symptoms, asking questions, actively thinking or attempting to look at the problem from a different point of view will help you seperate the relevent issues from the misnomers.
