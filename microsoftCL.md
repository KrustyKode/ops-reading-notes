#### How can you list the files in the current directory using the command prompt?
    Once you are inside of the command prompt, you can do this by simply typing the dir command.


#### How might the “sfc” command and the “gpupdate” command help in troubleshooting on Windows?
    the sfc command is an accronym for System File Checker, it scans core operating files inside windows.
    If files are missing or corrupted, sfc will attempt to reapir them. 
    gpuupdate allows an admin to make a group policies update. It can be combined with a /target and /force 
    to push an update to a specific computer. ie  gpupdate /target:mikes /force.



#### What advantages does the “robocopy” command offer over the “xcopy” command, and why is it useful for file transfers in certain situations?
    robocopy has unique features built into it that xcopy lacks. Namely the ability to resume a file transfer that has been interupted. This is beneficial for someone transferring very large files, or someone transferring with inconsistent internet connectivity.


#### Think about any real-life scenarios from your cultural context where the use of command line tools could be beneficial. Describe one such scenario and explain how a specific command line tool would help address the situation.
    One use I immediately think of is data recovery. Say someone working on a job site suddenly has their labtop screen stop working, if you are able to ssh into that computer you could use a command like xcopy or robocopy to transfer out crucial documents.
