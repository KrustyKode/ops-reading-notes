### CompTIA A+ 220-902 Troubleshooting Methodology


#### What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?
    More often then not, any given problem that you are given will have multiple syptoms.
    It can be helpful to chunk down a larger problem into its individual issues. 


#### What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?
    If possible, go ahead and implement that solution! If for whatever reason you can't immediatly implement the solution, come up with a plan of action on how this fix can be but into action.

#### What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?
    Documenting the troubleshooting process is critical. I will save yourself and others valuable time if and when this issue rears its head agian. It also allows you to easily go back and revert changes you made if they end up causing problems of their own.

#### Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?
    I used to work in a saltwater fish store and would have to walk people through troubleshooting equipment, both over the phone and in-person. I would always start from zero and assume that knew absolutley nothing. I would go though a checklist in my head, starting from is it fully plugged in and going from there.
