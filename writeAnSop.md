### So, You Want to Write an SOP?


##### What is a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), and why is it important for an organization?
    An SOP is a universal policy or best practice that is intrinsic to any given organization.

##### What are the three types of documents that should be included in an SOP manual? Briefly describe each type.
    SOP's require 3 different documents; all of equal importance.
    1. Policy, this is why portion.
    2. SOP, this tackles the latter 3 W's, what when and why. 
    3. Work Instructions answers the question of how. It should provide a consice
    step by step of expectations.

##### Why are SOPs considered a primary way to implement or enforce policies in an organization?
    SOP's are effective because an effective one is all encompasing. 
    They should be wall-to-wall, top down policies. 
    SOP's put the vision of a company into action.

##### What does the author emphasize regarding the audience when writing SOPs, and why is it essential to consider them?
    SOP's are non-standard. For the most part, two companies will have different SOP's because
    different companies NEED different SOP's. An SOP for Anne's baking company will be useless to
    BigComputer.Inc and vis versa.

##### Imagine you are a part of a multicultural team responsible for following an SOP. How would you address potential misunderstandings or differing interpretations of the procedure due to cultural differences? Propose strategies to foster effective cross-cultural communication.
    SOP's should be written in a way that ambiguity is nonexistent, ideally. 
    Everyones favorite razor would say the most effective SOP's 
    are short, consice, and not up for interpretation.
