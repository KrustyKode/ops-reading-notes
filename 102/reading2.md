### Building a PC

#### Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?

This is a subjective answer. It all depends on what you are setting out to accomplish. A workstation with multiple apps and processes running will benefit from a higher core count. Modern CPUs also include virtual cores to boost multitasking performance further.

Someone looking to run graphically intense programs might opt for the higher clock speed. 


#### What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?

Motherboard sockets seem to change with every new generation of CPU coming out recently. They are without a doubt the number one compatibility factor. 


#### What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
When building a new computer, you should consider what programs you will be using. The main philosiphy for years was to load OS and frequent apps on an SSD for the speed, and to load less essential things on an HDD. In recent years this is changing as SSD's have become drastically more affordable. 


#### Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?

I like to tell people to think about the individual parts as just big legos! Most of the major pieces just snap into place. Once you've done it a few times it will become kind of fun!
