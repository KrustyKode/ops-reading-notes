### Threat Hunting

#### How are Threat Hunting and Pentesting different?
    Threat Hunting is proactive, searching for hidden threats. Pentesting is testing for 
    vulnerabilities through simulated attacks.
#### What is the primary objective of Threat Hunting?
    To proactively find and assess potential compromises in the organization’s systems to prevent 
    breaches.
#### Your organization has a fully functioning SOC but not active Threat Hunting. How would you advocate for your security organization to start Threat Hunting activities?
    Highlight security gaps, demonstrate proactivity’s value, propose a pilot program, and offer 
    training.
