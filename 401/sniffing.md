### Sniffing and Evasion

#### Explain a Sniffing attack using non-technical terms.
    Like someone secretly reading your letter before it reaches the intended recipient, a sniffing 
    attack involves intercepting digital communications covertly.
#### What are the two types of sniffing attacks and what are some pros and cons of each approach?
    Passive Sniffing: Quiet and less detectable but limited by network type.
    Active Sniffing: More aggressive and detectable, effective on various networks.
#### How does encryption protect traffic against sniffing attacks?
     It scrambles data so even if intercepted, it remains unreadable without a specific key, 
     thwarting the attacker's efforts to understand it.
