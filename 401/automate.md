### Is Cybersecurity Automation the Future?

#### How would a security team benefit from implementing a SOAR solution?
    SOAR or security automation and orchestration refers to any purpose-built tools
    that orchestrate activities between other security tools and perform specific
    automation activities in response to identified threats. Allowing security pros
    to more effectively do their job.

#### Explain how a SOAR solution fits into the Incident Response process.
    Tools that automatically collect and organize logs could be very useful
    to an incident response team. Allowing them to more easily identify the 
    what, when, where, and why of an attack.
