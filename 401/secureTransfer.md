### Applying The CIA Triad To Your Enterprise File Transfer

#### You have been made responsible for the companyâ€™s file server. How would you preserve the three elements of the CIA triad?
    You could easily insure that all three elements are upheld by using a service like  JSCAPE MFT Server,
    a managed file transfer server that that is an all-in-one solution.
#### Explain how hashing verifies data integrity using non-technical terms.
    Hashing simply insures that the data you recieved is the same data that was sent.
    A hash changes drastically if even one character is edited. 
#### How is hashing and encryption different?
    One major difference is that hashing is irreversible. Unlike encrypting something
    a hashed files cannot be unhashed.
