### Protecting Data at Rest with Device Encryption

#### From your day to day computer use, provide examples of when data is at rest and when it is in transit.
    My daily computer use consists of a lot of different things. Most days I am using the internet,
    uploading documents, using VScode to write and push code. These are all examples of data in transit.
    When data is not actively being sent or used, it is at rest.
#### Explain the role data encryption with regards to the CIA triad.
    encryption plays a key role in confidentiality. It keeps your data safe from prying eyes
    as even if it is intercepted, the information will be indecipherable.
