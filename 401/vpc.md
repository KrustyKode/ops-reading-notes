### Cloud Network Security.

#### What are some of the key features of the VPC model?
    VPCs provide isolated, customizable cloud segments with scalable resources and security controls.
#### What are the three tiers that comprise the three-tier architecture model?
    The Presentation Layer handles user interactions, the Business Logic Layer processes data and
    rules, and the Data Layer manages data storage.
#### Describe the differences between a VPC and a VPN to someone you know from your previous job.
    A VPC offers a private, customizable segment of a public cloud for dedicated resource
    management, while a VPN creates a secure, encrypted connection over the internet to extend a
    private network's reach.
