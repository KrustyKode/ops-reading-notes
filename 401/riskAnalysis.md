#### Consider a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad?
    The bank can do many things to help bolster the security of the atm. They could limit access, by having the atm behind a locked door that is unlocked with a debit card. This could help prevent anyone from eavesdropping
#### Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.
    Seperation of duties, mandatory vacations and job rotation are all considered best practices.
#### What are the three stages of the risk management lifecycle? What is each stageâ€™s main goal or objective?
    Risk assessment: Categorize, classify and evaluate assets, as well as identify threats and vulnerabilities
    Risk analysis: Both qualitative and quantitative
