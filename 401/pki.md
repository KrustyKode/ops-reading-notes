### What is Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

#### Name the three main components which make up PKI.

##### The three main components of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) are:
    Certificate Authority (CA): Issues and manages digital certificates.
    Digital Certificates: Electronic documents that link public keys with identities.
    Registration Authority (RA): Verifies the identities of entities requesting certificates, often working alongside the CA.

#### How would you explain, to a non-technical friend, the role PKI plays in protecting traffic between your browser and a web server.
    PKI is like a guarrd dog, when you try to visit a website it runs to the fence and sniffs out if
    something is legit. 
#### What is the main weakness of the PKI architecture?
    The main weakness of PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) is its heavy reliance on trust,
    particularly in Certificate Authorities (CAs). If a CA is compromised or acts maliciously,
    it can undermine the entire system.
