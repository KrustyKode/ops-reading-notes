### Log Analysis with Splunk

#### What are three tasks which SOCs often perform?
##### SOC Tasks:
    Monitoring & Analysis: Watch over network traffic and logs to spot security threats.
    Incident Response: Investigate and fix security threats to reduce damage.
    Threat Intelligence: Stay informed on cyber threats and advise the organization.
#### Explain what a SIEM solution is and how the SOC utilizes it in non-technical terms.
    Think of SIEM as a high-tech security system for IT, gathering and analyzing data from across the network to detect and respond to cyber threats, helping security teams act quickly.
#### How does the typical SOC team structure resemble the structure of an IT Help Desk.
    Both have tiered support levels, but SOC focuses on cybersecurity:
    Tier 1: Handles basic alerts and incidents.
    Tier 2: Deals with more complex issues, requiring deeper analysis.
    Tier 3: Tackles the most sophisticated security challenges with expert knowledge.
