### Modeling a Web Application

#### Explain threat modeling using real-world non-technical examples.
    It's like securing a vault. Identifying potential break-in points, 
    deciding on locks or security systems to protect those points, and 
    then checking if the security measures are effective.
#### What are the four questions that can help us organize threat modeling?
    What are we building?
    What can go wrong?
    How do we prevent it?
    Did our prevention methods work?
#### You are the project lead for a new application. How would you explain the benefits of Threat Modeling to the rest of the team?
     It's like using a gps for a road trip to avoid roadblocks. In 
     project terms, it helps us foresee and mitigate security risks, 
     ensuring a safer product for users and building trust with 
     stakeholders.
