### Automated AppSec with ZAP

#### What are the three common stages of the Penetration Testing process and what tasks are performed at each one?
    Reconnaissance: Gathering information about the target to understand its structure and
    vulnerabilities.

    Attack: Actively exploiting discovered vulnerabilities to assess the potential impact.

    Post-Exploitation: Evaluating the compromised system's value and maintaining access for further
    analysis.
#### Explain a “man-in-the-middle proxy” in non-technical terms.
    Main-in-the-middle proxy is like a mediator that sits between your browser and the internet,
    translating and inspecting messages between both, to ensure security or perform testing.
#### What are the 2 spiders available for use in ZAP?
    Traditional Spider: Best for static applications, quickly maps out web structure.

    AJAX Spider: Ideal for dynamic, JavaScript-heavy applications, discovering content loaded
    dynamically.
#### What situations are they best suited for?
    Traditional Spider: Use with less complex, standard web applications.
    
    AJAX Spider: Use with complex, modern web applications that use a lot of AJAX and JavaScript.
