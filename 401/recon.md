### Reconnaissance

#### How are the stages of a pen test very similar to those of the Cyber Kill Chain?
   Pen tests and the Cyber Kill Chain both follow a methodical approach, from scouting 
   vulnerabilities to achieving goals, showing the structured process in security assessment and 
   cyber attack analysis.
#### Your manager has asked you to explain the benefits of a pentest to the companyâ€™s leadership. How would you lead this conversation?
    pen testing spots vulnerabilities early, boosts our security, keeps us compliant, and protects 
    our reputation and finances from breaches. It's a vital part of our cybersecurity plan.
