### Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems

#### List 2 differences between firewalls and an IDS?
    Firewalls control access to a network by blocking or allowing traffic based on rules.
    IDS detects and alerts on suspicious activities without blocking traffic.

    Firewalls act as gatekeepers for network traffic.
    IDS monitors traffic passively, identifying potential threats.
#### Under what circumstances would you choose a network-based IDS over a host-based IDS?
    Large Networks: For monitoring extensive networks efficiently.
    Perimeter Defense: To examine inbound and outbound traffic for threats.
    Centralized Management: When centralized traffic analysis is preferred.
#### Name 3 major drawbacks of a NIDS?
    Encryption Issues: Struggles with analyzing encrypted traffic.
    False Positives: High likelihood of mistaking normal activities for threats.
    Resource Demands: Requires significant resources, potentially affecting performance.
