### Prep: Growth Mindset

### Software developers can get stuck in a comfortable rut, building the same things repeatedly. To truly level up, they need to actively seek out challenges that push their limits and force them to learn new skills. Ex:

#### Stepping outside your comfort zone: Tackle problems that are unfamiliar and make you sweat. Don't shy away from the steep learning curve!
    
#### Regular practice: Repetition is key. Regularly apply the new skills you're learning to solidify your understanding.

#### Clear feedback: Look for ways to measure your progress, be it through code execution or external feedback.

#### Embrace the struggle: Expect these challenges to be demanding and leave you mentally exhausted. That's a sign you're making progress!

#### Focus on learning: The end result is less important than the knowledge you gain along the way.

#### Resources like Matasano Crypto Challenges and Rosalind offer curated sets of problems specifically designed for this type of deliberate practice in different technical areas.
