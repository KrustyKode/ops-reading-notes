#### What are the benefits of a forward proxy?
##### Benefits of a Forward Proxy
    Anonymity: Hides user identities from external sites.
    Security: Blocks access to harmful sites and enforces content filtering.
    Caching: Improves loading times by storing frequently accessed content.
    Access Control: Manages internet access and usage within the organization.

#### Explain the differences between a forward and a reverse proxy?
##### Forward vs. Reverse Proxy Differences
    Direction of Traffic: Forward proxies manage outbound requests from users to the internet, while reverse proxies handle incoming requests to servers from the internet.
    Usage: Forward proxies focus on user anonymity and internet access control. Reverse proxies distribute traffic, enhance security, and improve performance for web services.
    Client Awareness: Users must configure their settings to use forward proxies, but are typically unaware of reverse proxies.
#### Explain to your manager why your organization might benefit from implementing a reverse proxy?
##### Benefits of a Reverse Proxy for an Organization
    Load Balancing: Distributes traffic to prevent server overloads, enhancing performance.
    Security: Adds a protection layer and hides server identities, improving security.
    Efficiency: Caches content and compresses data, speeding up web service delivery.
    SSL Termination: Handles encryption tasks, freeing up server resources for better performance.
    Centralized Control: Simplifies authentication and access management for web applications.
